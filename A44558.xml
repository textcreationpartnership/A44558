            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Strange News from <hi>Staffordſhire:</hi> Being a true RELATION OF TWO Bloody Murders Committed by one <hi>Andrew Sympſon,</hi> Upon the Bodies of a young Man and a young Woman.</head>
            <p>O What a world of Curſes the eating of the forbidden fruit hath brought upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde! and unavoidably entail'd upon the Sons of Men great Miſery; amongſt all which none appears more terrible and full of Sorrow, and bewraying greater Wrath, than the Blood-crying Sin of Murder, eſpecially when it is attended with Crimes, whoſe Wickedneſs of themſelves might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the reward of Death: which in the Perſon, of whom this Relation is written, might have been fully evidenced, before he committed this horrible Action, for which he received his juſt Reward or Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The place of his uſual abode was <hi>Leeke,</hi> a Town in the <hi>Moorlands</hi> in <hi>Stafford ſhire;</hi> his Name <hi>Andrew Sympſon,</hi> by Trade a Shoe-maker, and ſome time an Oſtler in an Inne in the ſame Town, where he firſt begun to act his wicked Deſigns: For, about two years ago, a Countryman coming to Market in <hi>Leeke,</hi> he ſet up his Horſe at the <hi>Red-Lion,</hi> where <hi>Andrew</hi> was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30222:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->Hoſtler; and from thence going into the Town, he received, for Corn, ſome Three Pounds, which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a large Leather-purſe in his Pocket, he in the Evening comes to his Inne, and drinking indifferent hard, ſtays till 10 of the Clock or thereabouts (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>September,</hi> the Nights dark;) he then calls for the Oſtler, and giving him two Pence for his horſe, he rode homewards towards his own houſe, which was ſome four Miles from <hi>Leek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Andrew</hi> ſeeing this Purſe of Money, and judging it to be more than it was, he takes a Horſe of his Maſter's out of the Stable; he rides a nearer way through a back-ground of his Maſter's, and meets the Country-man in an open large Moor; where bidding him ſtand, he robs him of his Money, and then with a Horſe-collar, or Halter, binds his hands and feet, looſing his Horſe to run home; and ſo leaves the poor Country-man in great diſtreſs all Night on the cold ground, Moneyleſs and comfortleſs.</p>
            <p>Next Morning he was by Country-people found, and came back to <hi>Leeke,</hi> where he made known his bad Misfortune: But none could ſuſpect <hi>Andrew</hi> to be the Actor in this Fact.</p>
            <p>After this prize, he continues a good time honeſt, till another opportunity affords it ſelf to his eye, which he would not let ſlip; which was as followeth:</p>
            <p>About ſix months after the former Robbery, there came a youngman to the houſe on foot, traveling for <hi>Nantwich</hi> in <hi>Cheſhier,</hi> who over-night inquiring in the houſe of his way, next day none was ſo forward as <hi>Andr.</hi> to inform him, or to get into the acquaintance of this Stranger, who, by his own laviſh diſcourſe, diſcovers he had good ſtore of Money, and that he had lately left his Friends upon Diſcontent. <hi>Andrew</hi> informs him of the beſt way he could towards <hi>Congerton</hi> ſeven miles on his way, and himſelf proffered next morning to put him in the right way for a mile or two. The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30222:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->Stranger accepts his proffer; and ſo in the morning out they go together, their way lying over a great and almoſt unfrequented Moore, and ſo through a great diſmal Wood; in the midſt of which he takes an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and with one blow of a heavy Stick he knocks the poor Traveller down; but not ſo content, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubles his blows till he found him breathleſs on the ground: which when he perceived, he took out of his Pocket ſix pounds in Gold and Silver, with two Rings, and a ſilver Box, and then takes the Body and drags it into an old uſeleſs Coal pit; which being left open and deep, the Body was not found till his Confeſſion before Juſtice <hi>Anderſon</hi> in <hi>June</hi> laſt, 79.</p>
            <p>From acting this horrible Crime, he comes home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Leeke,</hi> no body ever ſuſpecting him: for he eaſily told where he pretended he parted with the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and they never thinking but he was gone his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrew</hi> upon this Theft was full of money, which he freely ſpent, the onely way to be poor again, and ſo to be tempted to another ſin or Robbery. He was ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an Artiſt, as he never expoſed the Rings to ſale in <hi>Leek,</hi> but once going over to <hi>Stafford,</hi> he there to a Goldſmith ſells them, with the Box pretending he found them.</p>
            <p>After this, he continues till <hi>May</hi> laſt, without acting any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty to be detected; but though he was aſleep in ſecurity, he could not eſcape the Divine Vengeance for his horrid Facts: for now the time of his apprehenſion drew on, and that he muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Account for all his ſins before the Terreſtrial and Coeleſtial Judges. He obſerves in <hi>May</hi> laſt, a woman, who coming to <hi>Leeke</hi> with Cloath, Lace and Thread, and other Pedlers Commodities, ſhe took ſome money in the Town, and with what ſhe had before, it was pretty conſiderable. She then intends for the Town of <hi>Bakewel,</hi> North-weſt from thence, where ſhe muſt paſs by a place called the <hi>black Mere of Morridge,</hi> which is a ſtrange deep black water-pond of a very prodigious depth and colour, differing from moſt ordinary waters. <hi>Andrew</hi> learns what way ſhe muſt travel, but in his heart he intends to prevent her Journey, and adde one more great ſin to his two former. This place was ſome ſeven miles
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30222:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 8 -->or thereabouts from <hi>Leeke;</hi> and it was almoſt three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon ere ſhe went out of Town, and conſequently it muſt be near night ere ſhe paſt by this unfrequented place. <hi>Andrew</hi> follows her, pretending he was going to a Town three miles off; but he dogs this woman, and follows her to the very place he intended, where by force he firſt ſtrangles her, and then taking her Purſe of money from her ſide, and her Boxes of Lace, and her Linnen, he tyes a Rope to her middle, and a great Stone to the end of it, and throws her into the Mere; and ſo packing up his Prize he hyes home, where he gets before morning, and in a Hay-mow hides all his Purchaſe: which he had not long poſſeſt, but being over-kind with a Maid-ſervant in the houſe, he tells her he would give her ſome Lace and Linnen; which ſhe being glad to hear, often tells, and urges him for his promiſe. At laſt ſhe ſo much tires him, that he goes one day to fetch her ſome of both; but ſhe watching him privately, wonders to ſee him from the Hay-mow draw forth ſuch a quantity of Linnen and Lace. She ſays nothing to him, but at night, ſick of a womans diſtemper, ſhe tells her other fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who could ſcarce believe it; but the other affirming it, ſhe next day tells her Miſtriſs, who alſo wondering, ſends for <hi>Andrew,</hi> and taxes him, but he denies it ſtoutly. She then calls her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he going to look in the very place, they finde all the Linnen and Lace, and ſome Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrew</hi> was ſecured, and carried before a Juſtice; where, after a many ſtrange Excuſes, he confeſſes the Fact: and for it being committed to the Goal, he was, this laſt Aſſizes there held, Condemn'd: And then he confeſſed the other two Facts, receiving the juſt Reward of his horrible Murders and Robberies.</p>
